**Welcome to My Personal Blog – Not Too Academic, But Very Casual**

Let me start with a bit of my "academic" background, though I wouldn’t call myself particularly accomplished in this area.
I’m Damons, a graduate of the Mathematics Department at North China University of Technology. My research focused on computer graphics and computer vision. I’ve always had a passion for geometry, which led me to work in the CAD & CAE industry after graduation. Over the years, I’ve worked at several companies, all within the fields of graphics and vision. Recently, due to team restructuring, I transitioned into artificial intelligence, specializing in AIGC model optimization.

**About Life**

I have a wonderful family—my wife, Joney, and my daughter, Valdrada.
I’m a big fan of Italo Calvino’s books, and Invisible Cities is one of my favorites. My daughter’s name, Valdrada, comes from one of the cities in the book. This city is built on the shores of a lake, where every building is perfectly reflected in the water, creating a world where reality and its mirror image coexist. I found the name incredibly poetic and philosophically profound, so I chose it for my daughter.

**About This Blog**

I’ve always wanted to have my own blog. I once came across a [blog](https://jax-ml.github.io/scaling-book/) with a beautifully clean and minimalist interface, and I was immediately drawn to it. That inspired me to create my own. After some research, I discovered [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/tree/main)—both fantastic solutions—so I used them as the foundation to build my blog.
Here, I plan to document and share my thoughts. Some posts will be about technology, but more often, I’d like to capture moments from life and the joy of reading. Occasionally, I might also write about technical topics.
